# 👋 Hi, I’m Melvyn Chemin

I’m a Machine Learning Engineer and AI researcher passionate about building **intelligent, modular, and efficient systems** — from **LLM-powered retrieval pipelines** to **multi-agent architectures** for automation and reasoning.

Currently, I’m focusing my time on:
- 🧩 **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems** — building production-grade pipelines (BM25 + dense embeddings + RAPTOR summarization + query classifiers) for context-aware LLMs.  
- 🤖 **Multi-Agent Frameworks** — designing agent stacks for AI reasoning, automation, and self-diagnosis of business needs.  
- ⚙️ **Optimization & Systems Engineering** — accelerating Python/C++ inference pipelines (20–40× speedups achieved at Rolex).  
- 🔍 **Open-Source AI Infrastructure** — working on [MEGARAG](https://github.com/MelvynChemin/MEGARAG), a framework for customizable, over-engineered RAG systems.

## 🎯 What I’m Aiming For

I’m currently seeking or open to roles such as:
- **AI / ML Engineer**  
- **Applied Research Scientist**  
- **AI Infrastructure Engineer**  
- **Research Engineer (LLMs / RAG / Multi-Agent Systems)**  
- **Entrepreneurial Collaborations** — building tools or startups at the intersection of AI, automation, and efficiency.

Long-term, I aim to work on **self-hosted and privacy-focused AI solutions for European companies**, while continuing to contribute to the open-source AI ecosystem.
